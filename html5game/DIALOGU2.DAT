
\ 
\  we have more pressing concerns, velasquez.  just before he died,
\philip performed a microtron scan on the android prototype.  the
\scan detected a suspicious programming anomaly in the areo-1"s
\security subprocessor... a defect in the android"s root command
\structure.  i never mentioned it to anybody, but when i talked
\to kane, he assumed right away that there must be a glitch in
\the security subprocessor of the areo-2 model.
\ 

. 
.  glitch, my ass!  that bastard kane probably put it there

\that philip contacted kane once, just before he was killed.

. 
.  philip must"ve uncovered something suspicious, and kane programmed
.the android to kill him.
. 

\ 
\  the lab files were virtually wiped out.  although kane"s berserk
\android ionized most of the databanks, we"ve managed to recover a
\fragment of philip"s research from the isolated file index.
\ 

\  philip found that both you and the prototype were virtually 
\identical in structure... which would imply that those synthetics
\are pretty well the same as you.
\ 

. 
.  vectorbot must have its own dr. ramses.  if philip were just
.a clone, the real ramses must still be out there somewhere.
. 

\ 
\  kane said he wanted to offer philip a deal at vectorbot.  the
\real ramses must"ve wanted his rogue clone returned.
\

.  let"s ask kane what he knows!  i"m sure i can persuade him to
.be cooperative!
