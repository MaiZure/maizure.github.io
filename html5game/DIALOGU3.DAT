  one of my duties as vice-director is to conduct routine inspections

inspections, especially when the frontier is plagued with rumors

 

. 
.  jekar and the others were simply a ruse.  whenever you needed a reason

. 


  if i were not your prisoner, captain velasquez, i would currently be
conducting a surprise inspection of a bluerite mining facility, searching
for possible saboteurs or splinter faction sympathizers.  under normal

his successor.
 

. 
.  so you"ve conspired with orlok to eliminate him.  how noble.
.

 
  the overlord is already dead, velasquez.  we must take advantage of
his misfortune before someone else does.  traditionally, the new overlord

highest honor.  between them, they"ve conquered or decimated more than
fifty civilizations, mine and yours among them.
 

  to keep the peace, each general has been assigned one quadrant of the
city.  orlok occupies the beta quadrant.  talon, marilith and kreel
command the remaining three.  there exists a mutual, if tenuous,
concession among the generals not to invade each other"s territory.


can work with orlok to establish peaceful relations with previously 
conquered worlds.  none of the other generals are as willing to use their
power constructively.
 

. 
.  or maybe orlok"s as ruthless as they come.  once he gains control of
.the overlord"s empire, what"s to keep him from destroying you and anyone
.else who gets in his way?  has that even occurred to you?!
