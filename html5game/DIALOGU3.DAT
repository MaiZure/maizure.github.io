€

.  jekar and the others were simply a ruse.  whenever you needed a reason

. 


€his successor.
€

. 
.  so you"ve conspired with orlok to eliminate him.  how noble.

€  the overlord is already dead, velasquez.  we must take advantage of

€highest honor.  between them, they"ve conquered or decimated more than
€fifty civilizations, mine and yours among them.
€ 

€  to keep the peace, each general has been assigned one quadrant of the
€city.  orlok occupies the beta quadrant.  talon, marilith and kreel
€command the remaining three.  there exists a mutual, if tenuous,
€concession among the generals not to invade each other"s territory.
€

€ 
€  exactly.  jekar will be the perfect facsimile... genetically identical

€can work with orlok to establish peaceful relations with previously 
€conquered worlds.  none of the other generals are as willing to use their
€power constructively.
€ 

. 
.  or maybe orlok"s as ruthless as they come.  once he gains control of
.the overlord"s empire, what"s to keep him from destroying you and anyone
.else who gets in his way?  has that even occurred to you?!
